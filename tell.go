// why). It reads the reasons disguise.go writes, so each of them has a short
// form here; TestEveryDisguiseHasATell keeps the two together. What the peer
// did - pinging every few seconds, asking for addresses again and again -
// comes before what it says about itself, and two reasons are told where
// there are two (09.11.2026: "misspelt name" alone said too little). A
// protocol number only where nothing else tells (10.11.2026: beside a
// behaviour it said nothing more, only made the line long). LinkingLion's
// own reason is the pill itself, so one piece of its other evidence is told,
