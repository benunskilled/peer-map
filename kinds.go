// What kind of software a peer runs, read off the user agent it sent in its
// version message.
//
// This is what the peer SAYS it is, and a user agent is a free-text field the
// other side chooses. On the node this was written for, four connections
// announced themselves as "/Sat0shi:31.0.0/" - Bitcoin Core with a zero in
// place of the o - from rented machines in five regions. So the kind is a
// label, not evidence.
//
// The counterweight is in the three observed flags on Peer, which nobody can
// write into a string: what the peer offers, whether it wants transactions,
// and whether Core has ever learned which chain it is on. A peer calling
// itself Core while offering nothing and having no known chain is the
// interesting case, and it is visible only because the two are shown side by
// side.
//
// The name answers the question somebody actually has, which is not "what
// software is this" but "is this a node that could hand me a block". So the
// class comes first and the software after it: "Node (Core)", not "Core".
//
// Order matters: the first match wins, so a more specific pattern goes above
// a more general one (Knots before Core - a Knots user agent contains
// "Satoshi" too).
//
// relays says whether this kind of software passes blocks on at all. It is the
// same distinction Bitcoin Lab paints red in its peer list, and it has to stay
// the same in both apps: a colour that means two different things in two
// windows of the same node is worse than no colour.
//
// A wallet has nothing to relay, a crawler is there to look, an indexer serves
// somebody else's wallet. Measured across 2,270 peers on one node: 688 of them
// ran software like this, 790 observations between them, and not one block
// delivered first. Unknown software counts as relaying - not knowing is not the
// same as knowing it cannot.
