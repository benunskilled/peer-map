# The build stage runs on the build machine's own architecture and
# cross-compiles, so the arm64 image needs no QEMU to build - Go does it
# natively with CGO off. The result is one static binary with the dashboard,
# the world map and the region and network tables embedded.
# The Go release is the one go.mod names, pinned by digest - the multi-arch
# index, so this stage resolves on any build machine - like the images the
# store pins. toolchain_test.go keeps the two in step.
