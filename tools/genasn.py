"""Build asn/asn.bin - the network-operator table Peer Map embeds - from
ip-location-db's ASN database (RouteViews + DB-IP, see LICENSES in the package).

    pip install maxminddb
    npm pack @ip-location-db/asn-mmdb && tar xzf ip-location-db-asn-mmdb-*.tgz
    python3 tools/genasn.py package/asn-ipv4.mmdb package/asn-ipv6.mmdb asn/asn.bin

The map answers "where", this answers "whose". They are different questions and
the second is often the more useful one for a node: three peers can sit in three
different countries and still be three machines in one data centre, which is no
diversity at all - measured on one real node, three of eight manual peers were
in three different /16 networks, in the same country, all at the same operator.
Only the AS number showed it.

What the app needs is the number and a name, so the database is reduced to
exactly that. Adjacent ranges belonging to the same AS are merged, which takes
564,579 IPv4 ranges down to 395,480; gaps between assigned ranges get an
explicit "unknown" entry so a lookup cannot fall through into the next range.

Layout (big-endian), the same shape as geo.bin so the two readers stay familiar:
    "PMASN1"
    nAS uint32, then per AS: number uint32, name length uint8, name UTF-8
    n4 uint32, then n4 x uint32 range start, then n4 x uint32 AS index
    n6 uint32, then n6 x uint64 range start (upper 64 bits), then n6 x uint32 AS index
AS index 0 is "unknown" (number 0, empty name) and marks the gaps. IPv6 is keyed
on the upper 64 bits, exactly as in geo.bin; where ranges collapse onto the same
64-bit start, the later one wins.

It also writes asn/testdata/vectors.json: addresses sampled from the databases
with the AS a direct lookup in the .mmdb gives for them, for asn_test.go.
